    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: 03/17/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>LinkedIn AI Detector</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. The extension only analyzes publicly available LinkedIn post content to determine the likelihood of AI-generated text.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>The analysis is done locally on your browser, and no user data is sent to our servers. If API calls are made to an external service, only the LinkedIn post content is processed for AI detection purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires the following permissions:
        <ul>
            <li>Access to LinkedIn posts for AI analysis.</li>
            <li>Storage permission for saving user preferences.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or transfer user data to third parties. If our extension integrates with any external AI service, the interaction is limited to the necessary analysis without storing user data.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
